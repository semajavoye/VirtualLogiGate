# VirtualLogiGate

VirtualLogiGate is a digital logic simulator developed by **Semaja VoyÃ©**. Its primary purpose is the **visualization and accurate simulation of digital logic gates**.

It is engineered entirely in **C**, leveraging the language for **maximum performance, memory efficiency, and deterministic, low-level execution control**â€”a perfect fit for a systems-level application.

VirtualLogiGate is currently **under active development**. Contributions that enhance core performance, stability, architectural elegance, or usability are highly valued. Letâ€™s build something we can be proud ofâ€”**a clean, highly performant, and educational logic simulator developed from the ground up.**

## Installation and Build Process

To build **VirtualLogiGate**, you require a **C compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC). On Windows, the recommended development environment is **MSYS2/MinGW** integrated with **Visual Studio Code**.

## Features

### âœ… **Implemented (Core Logic):**

* **Fundamental Logic Gates:** AND, OR, INVERT (NOT), NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.
* **Debug Visualization:** Console-based output for initial structure verification and logic debugging.
* **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns using C header files for component definitions and function prototypes.

### ðŸš§ **In Active Development (Visualization & Simulation Flow):**

* **Interactive GUI:** Planned implementation using the SDL3 library.
* **Signal Propagation Model:** Robust simulation of wire connection logic and signal flow across gates.
* **Persistence:** Implementation of save/load functionality for circuit files (planned `.vlg` format).
* **Logical Simplification Engine:** Algorithms for optimizing and reducing complex gate structures.

### ðŸ§  **Future Scope (Advanced Systems):**

* **Parallel Processing:** Multi-threaded simulation engine for scaling performance with large circuits.
* **Timing Analysis:** Integration of signal delay and critical path analysis capabilities.
* **Graphical Editor:** Drag-and-drop circuit construction interface.
* **Educational Mode:** Features for step-by-step logic tracing and gate function explanation.
